# Code Optimization Tips

## Performance
- Use appropriate data structures for your use case
- Cache results of expensive operations
- Minimize database queries by batching when possible
- Use asynchronous operations for I/O-bound tasks
- Profile your code to identify bottlenecks

## Memory Management
- Be mindful of memory leaks (especially in long-running applications)
- Use efficient data structures that match your access patterns
- Release resources when they're no longer needed
- Consider using object pooling for frequently created/destroyed objects

## Best Practices
- Write clean, readable code first, then optimize if needed
- Use built-in language features and libraries when possible
- Keep performance-critical code paths simple
- Document performance assumptions and optimizations
- Test performance with realistic data and workloads
